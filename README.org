** Description

Working solution for the School 21's educational algorythmic project *lem-in*.

It utilizes modified Edmonds-Karp algorythm in order to find a set of quickest routes for a given number of ants through a given "ant farm".

** Usage

To compile run =make=, =lem-in= binary will be generated.

To run program just pass some "map" to it, for example one from the included =maps= folder:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

./lem-in < maps/ant_farm.txt

#+END_SRC

42's map generator is also included as =lemin-gen=, run it separatly to examine options:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

lemin-gen --help

#+END_SRC

You can pass auto-generated map to the program like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

lemin-gen --big | ./lem-in

#+END_SRC

Use =check_all.sh= script to test program for all the cases provided by the generator. To view its options run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

./check_all.sh -h

#+END_SRC
