* TODO Fix problems
  - [ ] Make sure program finds looped links and shoots error
  - [ ] Bug: program can't find all paths on map "2.map"
  - [ ] Fix errors reported by dbendu (~/Pictures/Screenshots/slack*)
* DONE Rewrite main algorythm
  - [X] Rewrite adjacency matrix initialization (symbols: 'x', '-', '0', '+')
  - [X] Change BFS (=find_path=) in a way it to use only '-' or '0' edges during work
  - [X] Change =choose_path= in a way it to update adj_matrix cells
  - [X] Remove gateways' queue formation from =choose_path=
  - [X] Form gateways' queue right after BFS finishes its work
  - [X] Fix bug with assigning right symbols to edges leading to end room
  - [ ] Fix possible bugs preventing algorythm from working perfectly
