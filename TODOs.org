* TODO Fix problems
  - [ ] Make sure program finds looped links and shoots error
  - [ ] Bug: program can't find all paths on map "2.map"
  - [ ] Fix errors reported by dbendu (~/Pictures/Screenshots/slack*)
  - [ ] Fix bug with crash on empty line after farm description
* DONE Rewrite main algorythm
  - [X] Rewrite adjacency matrix initialization (symbols: 'x', '-', '0', '+')
  - [X] Change BFS (=find_path=) in a way it to use only '-' or '0' edges during work
  - [X] Change =choose_path= in a way it to update adj_matrix cells
  - [X] Remove gateways' queue formation from =choose_path=
  - [X] Form gateways' queue right after BFS finishes its work
  - [X] Fix bug with assigning right symbols to edges leading to end room
* DONE Handle ants' possible deficiency
  - [X] Assign depth property to every gateway
  - [X] Sort gateways in ascending order using depth property
  - [X] Create new data structure - =path=
  - [X] Write function =init_and_append_path=
  - [X] Rewrite =build_parents= in order to work with paths instead of gateways
  - [X] =calculate_gateways_depths= -> =calculate_paths_depths=
  - [X] Write =print_paths= function
  - [X] =sort_gateways= -> =sort_paths=
  - [X] Assign ants to paths using algorythm
  - [X] Send ants along their ways turn by turn
* NEXT Try to handle "better-one-path" situation
  - [X] Cleanup code - norminette and leaks
  - [ ] Isolate process of finding paths into a separate function
  - [ ] Implement a way to store number of turns
  - [ ] Increase number of paths iteratively
